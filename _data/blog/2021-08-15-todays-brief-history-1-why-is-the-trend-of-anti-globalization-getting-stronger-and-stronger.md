Hello everyone,\
\
Today we are going to share a new book,\
\
That is the Israeli writer historian,\
\
A brief history of Dr. Harari’s latest masterpiece today,\
\
\
This is the final piece of his trilogy of brief history,\
\
The first two books, a brief history of mankind and a brief history of the future,\
\
Let Harari become popular,\
\
The book Harari aligned,\
\
Some of the problems that mankind must face right now,\
\
And put forward the current human society,\
\
Facing technological disruption and ecological collapse,\
\
And the three major challenges of nuclear war.\
\
\
The identity of "country",\
\
Is not enough to meet today’s challenges,\
\
No country can,\
\
Solve global problems independently.\
\
Artificial intelligence and biotechnology,\
\
Is subverting the original social structure and distribution methods,\
\
Data becomes the most important resource,\
\
In this book, Harari puts forward more,\
\
Thinking about the topic without giving a special answer.\
\
Let’s go directly to this book below,\
\
Look at the first chapter, the disillusionment of ideals,\
\
From the old story to the new story,\
\
In the 20th century, the elites of mankind,\
\
In fact, I told you three stories,\
\
The story of fascism,\
\
The story of communism,\
\
And the story of liberalism,\
\
Fascism basically ceased to exist after World War II.\
\
And after the 90s,\
\
The story of communism is basically not mentioned,\
\
There is only liberalism left in the world,\
\
Let the world’s elites yearn for it.\
\
In this story,\
\
Eulogizing the power and value of freedom,\
\
Let people continue to fight for freedom,\
\
But this story also admits,\
\
The world is not perfect,\
\
There are still many obstacles to overcome, all\
\
There are still many dictatorships in the world,\
\
Even in a free country,\
\
There are also many citizens who endure oppression,\
\
But we already know the correct way,\
\
That is to let everyone have the right to vote,\
\
Build a free market,\
\
At present, the world has formed one,\
\
Organic whole, globalization,\
\
The general trend of liberalization is unstoppable,\
\
As long as a country joins this trend,\
\
Will get more peace and prosperity,\
\
If you don’t join the trend of globalization,\
\
Then it will die ugly.\
\
We see the global emergence,\
\
Countries in vicious crisis,\
\
What Syria, Zimbabwe,\
\
Venezuela, including Turkey,\
\
Argentina, these are,\
\
Countries that are not deeply involved in globalization,\
\
All kinds of crises are easy to break out.\
\
But since the 2008 global financial crisis,\
\
The story of liberalism from people around the world,\
\
I can't help but feel disappointed.\
\
There are more and more barriers and firewalls,\
\
Anti-immigration and anti-trade are getting stronger and stronger,\
\
On the surface it is a democratic system,\
\
But it restricts judicial independence and freedom of the press,\
\
Of course, this mainly refers to countries in the Western world.\
\
Because the author mainly criticized Brexit,\
\
And Trump came to power,\
\
He said that this represents this wave of retrogression in liberalization,\
\
Touched the core countries,\
\
In other words,\
\
It turns out that humans have three stories to choose from,\
\
But now there is no more,\
\
Everything seems to have lost its meaning.\
\
But at the micro level,\
\
Various new technologies are being applied,\
\
The society is rapidly changing under the guidance of technology,\
\
So that few people can understand,\
\
With the continuous improvement of artificial intelligence,\
\
Will one day,\
\
The entire financial environment will succumb to an algorithm,\
\
Will blockchain and Bitcoin change the monetary system?

\
Even future transactions,\
\
May no longer need any currency,\
\
No more money,\
\
There is no way for the country to collect taxes.\
\
And information becomes,\
\
Important assets in the economic system,\
\
So how to collect taxes on information,\
\
This is still quite an idea.\
\
Humans designed irrigation systems before,\
\
Know how to guide the flow of water,\
\
But I don’t know how to prevent my own aging,\
\
I don’t know how to change the brain,\
\
But now we can have the ability,\
\
Through the revolution of biotechnology and information technology,\
\
To control their inner world.\
\
Can even design and manufacture life,\
\
But the most difficult thing is not design.\
\
But use, for example,\
\
We can easily design the dam,\
\
But when using it,\
\
But I don't know what additional consequences will be.\
\
So it’s the same now,\
\
We can create life,\
\
Can change the brain,\
\
But I dare not apply,\
\
Because I don't know what unforeseen disasters are.\
\
Any political campaign,\
\
Will emphasize the status of the people,\
\
Ordinary workers are painted on the poster,\
\
Farmer, tell you,\
\
You are the masters of this country,\
\
But in fact, many people,\
\
On the contrary, I already feel that I am insignificant,\
\
What globalization, blockchain,\
\
Genetic engineering, artificial intelligence,\
\
It seems to have nothing to do with ordinary people,\
\
in other words,\
\
In the past, everyone rebelled against the political elite,\
\
The powerful economy exploits the people,\
\
But now it seems that everyone is more willing to resist,\
\
The elites don't need the people anymore.\
\
This kind of antinomy is insignificant,\
\
It is much more difficult than anti-exploitation and oppression,\
\
What the author means is,\
\
Now the world has begun to be driven by technology,\
\
And the technology drive becomes,\
\
What a few elites are doing,\
\
The power of the people is becoming less and less important,\
\
Since you are insignificant,\
\
Naturally it will not give you too much freedom.\
\
So the story is for politics,\
\
Liberalism was also for expansion in the beginning,\
\
And capitalism takes care of the working-class emotions,\
\
So the capitalist world has started high welfare,\
\
Even far surpassing socialism,\
\
Then Te Lpu came on stage,\
\
The ideology began to change,\
\
Different from fascism,\
\
Communism and liberalism,\
\
A wave of nihilism came into being.\
\
Special LP tells everyone,\
\
The United States is not responsible for making,\
\
And promote any global vision,\
\
And those who voted for Trumpu,\
\
It’s not that they oppose democracy,\
\
Oppose freedom, but because they have lost confidence in globalization,\
\
They think it is enough for liberal democracy to prevail in the country.\
\
There is no need to rescue those humans who are unable to fight.\
\
It is even more impossible to give up your own interests,\
\
And to liberate them, contrary to the practice of the United States and the United Kingdom,\
\
The image of Zhong G rose instantly,\
\
If you want to talk about free trade and international cooperation,\
\
It looks like Country Z is more like one,\
\
Active advocate of globalization,\
\
This is the original words of the author.\
\
\
To speak of fighting against globalization,\
\
Russians are more qualified,\
\
They provided a set,\
\
Another model outside of the liberal democratic system,\
\
But this model is not complete,\
\
Or should be more accurately\
\
A political manipulation,\
\
That is constantly failing one's own governance,\
\
Attributed to external persecution,\
\
When he took control of the media,\
\
It also keeps covering up the truth and guiding public opinion.\
\
So even if Russia’s economic problems are very serious,\
\
The original big brother, after so many years of tossing,\
\
Now the total economic output is not as good as that of our Guangdong Province,\
\
But it still does not hinder the status of Putin.\
\
Those right-wing extremists,\
\
Maybe I admire Putin,\
\
But they never want themselves,\
\
Living in ELs,\
\
I don't even want my country to become Russia.\
\
According to the survey, 87% of Russia’s wealth,\
\
Concentrated in the hands of 10%,\
\
So when it comes to the rich man of E Ross,\
\
Are all super rich representatives,\
\
But the people are very poor.\
\
People all over the world are also voting with their feet,\
\
As close as possible to the life they yearn for,\
\
So just look at the population flow trend.\
\
Human beings are now unwilling to give up easily,\
\
The story of liberalism,\
\
It's just that this kind of thing has been added,\
\
Some local nationalism.\
\
Each country and region has its own feelings,\
\
Why should outsiders intervene in my affairs,\
\
Even if he is right,\
\
You will also feel that he interferes with your freedom.\
\
We should control our own destiny by ourselves,\
\
Let yourself be restored to the glory of the past,\
\
Trump called on the United States to adopt isolationism,\
\
Promise to make America great again,\
\
That's what I mean,\
\
He thinks that the beauty of the 80s is perfect,\
\
It's the same in Britain, they left Europe,\
\
Is the dream of becoming an independent power,\
\
Back to the Victorian era,\
\
I don’t want to be held back by other European countries,\
\
And the Russians of Putin,\
\
The original intention is not an oligopoly,\
\
But to revive the glory of Tsarist Russia,\
\
As for Turkey, Poland, and the Islamic region,\
\
They all have their respective glory.

\
Faced with all this,\
\
The liberal elites,\
\
Was very panicked,\
\
The last speech of the former President of the United States and the United States.\
\
Pointed out a fact,\
\
Although liberalism still has many flaws,\
\
But his performance in history,\
\
Far stronger than any other solution,\
\
Under the aegis of liberalism,\
\
The global economy got it,\
\
Unprecedented peace and prosperity,\
\
For the first time in history, most people died without disease,\
\
Instead of dying due to illness,\
\
It's obesity to death, not starvation to death,\
\
It was an accident, not a violent death.\
\
The reason why liberalism can prevail,\
\
It’s by constantly making the cake in everyone’s hands bigger,\
\
Everyone’s life is better,\
\
So we can live in harmony,\
\
But now,\
\
This cake continues to inflate and is challenged,\
\
Because the ecology does not allow it,\
\
People all over the world live beautiful days,\
\
So there is a barrier.\
\
American people think,\
\
Poor people in other worlds,\
\
It drags them down to become better,\
\
The people of other countries think,\
\
American G people occupy more social resources,\
\
Liberalism has encountered challenges.\
\
The biggest problem facing mankind now is,\
\
How to break this game,\
\
So-called information technology,\
\
And biotechnology, artificial intelligence,\
\
It will continue to increase in the coming decades,\
\
It will also bring unprecedented and difficult tests to mankind.\
\
One of the most direct feelings is employment!\
\
When you grow up, you may not have a job,\
\
Maybe in 10-20 years,\
\
There will be billions of people around the world becoming redundant,\
\
The machine can complete most of the manufacturing,\
\
Although some people are saying,\
\
The machine deprives you of a position,\
\
He will create a new position for you again,\
\
You see, the loom has taken a lot of jobs from the weavers,\
\
But in the end, the amount of employment in industry,\
\
It is more and more full than the employment in the era of small workshops.\
\
\
But the author believes that this time may be different,\
\
If the machine has the ability to learn,\
\
May change the supply and demand relationship of labor,\
\
Hearing this, did the chrysanthemum tighten,\
\
So how will the author explain it?\
\
How should we face,\
\
The employment crisis caused by technological progress,

Let's break it down next time!
