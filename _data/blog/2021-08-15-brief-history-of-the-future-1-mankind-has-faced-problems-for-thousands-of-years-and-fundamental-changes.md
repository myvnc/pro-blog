Hello, friends,

Today we share a very popular book,

It's also a book that opens everyone's brains,

A brief history of the future, written by Dr. herali, who wrote a brief history of mankind,

Sometimes I'm tired of learning,

It's also interesting to read such brain opening books.

This is no idle book,

Read that to you,

Fantasy Fairy Xia novels are different,

The purpose of this book is to improve your pattern,

Only by improving the pattern,

You can see further.

How about a chess player,

Whether the chess power is high or not,

The key is how many changes he can see behind a move of chess,

Why can't people do alpha dogs,

Because he has calculated all the changes in the whole game,

So this is not a dimensional competition.

Naturally, human beings can only be completely defeated,

So besides go,

Where else will we lose to machines?

Herali asserts that 99% of people will become useless,

So how will these people survive in the future,

How miserable it will be,

Let's see what the book says.

First, chapter one,

Look at the new issues of mankind,

It turns out that the problem that mankind is most worried about is famine,

Plague and war, these are great troubles,

Generations have given their lives for this,

But now, at the beginning of the third millennium,

We have completely contained these three demons,

Famine and plague and all-out war,

Basically, it has been effectively controlled all over the world.

Hundreds of thousands of years ago,

We've been working on it,

This is also our lifelong goal,

But now this task,

With the sudden completion of scientific progress,

Like a firefighter was told,

It won't catch fire in the future,

Then we have to think about it now,

What should I do in the future?

Of course, here's a point,

Poverty is relative,

Now there are also African countries,

Living on less than $2 a day,

There are also many destitute families in China.

But this is far from that biological poverty line,

There is still a long way to go,

Real biological famine,

Often tragic,

Even people eat people and die of hunger everywhere.

Although many places are poor now,

But there's basically no such tragedy anymore,

In addition, the current famine is divided into three natural disasters and seven man-made disasters,

Where people starve to death,

Syria, Sudan, Somalia,

So obviously it's all politicians,

Not a real famine.

In other areas,

Even if a person has no job at all,

And lost the ability to work,

He's unlikely to starve,

At least one meal for various welfare benefits,

Even a full meal is no problem.

So the conclusion is,

Now, although hundreds of millions of people,

Still trapped in poverty and hunger,

But few people have been starved to death,

The author also specifically mentioned our China,

He said that in 1974,

Experts from various countries assert that,

China has always been short of food,

They will never be able to feed a billion people,

The world's most populous country,

The future will be a disaster.

But it turns out,

Not only did China not starve to death,

Still alive,

As long as the policy is open,

Instead, after 1978,

There was no more famine,

So before you say,

Continuous so-called natural disasters,

Whose problem is it.

So now the global topic has changed,

The problems facing mankind now,

No longer famine,

It's overeating.

It used to be said that a king,

idiot

Ask the common people why they don't drink broth without porridge,

But now this is really happening,

Now the poor are eating a lot of meat,

Meat eaters are no longer synonymous with the ruling class,

On the contrary, rich people began to pay attention to their diet.

Now many rich people,

They all have nutritionists,

Every day's meals are nutritionally prepared,

But the poor,

Fried chicken hamburger cream cake doesn't taste enough.

Malnutrition in 2010,

Took a million lives around the world,

But obesity kills 3 million people.

As for the plague,

The Black Death epidemic in medieval Europe,

It's actually a plague.

Half the people died in the outbreak of a plague,

The government has no choice but to pray.

And after Europeans discovered the American continent,

Also brought the smallpox virus,

It even killed 90% of local residents,

Like Mexico in 1520,

Before the Spanish came,

The population here is 22 million,

After 60 years, the population has been less than 2 million.

Captain Cook of England,

With the flu,

Tuberculosis and syphilis came to Hawaii,

As a result, 60 years later, Hawaii,

The population fell from 500000 to 70000.

In 1918,

A plague called Spanish flu,

In the barracks after World War I,

As a result, 50 million to 100 million people,

Lost his life,

Only 40 million people died in the whole world War I.

After entering modern society,

Although epidemics still exist,

But the case fatality rate has dropped significantly,

Smallpox has basically disappeared,

SARS in 2002, 2

Avian influenza in 2005,

Swine flu in 2010,

And Ebola in 2014,

There have been some panic,

But it was quickly brought under control,

The death toll was less than 1000,

Compared with the original number of deaths of hundreds of thousands,

The gap is huge.

There are also incurable diseases such as AIDS.

But this disease is weird,

He will be completely disguised under other diseases,

By destroying your immune system,

Increase your risk of other diseases.

But even so,

The emergence of new drugs has also controlled the virus,

It's very promising now,

Turn this incurable disease into a chronic disease,

That is, stick to treatment,

Your life can still last a long time.

As for cancer and heart disease,

The author said that this is not a disease at all,

People actually die,

As for why the ancients rarely had cancer and heart disease,

Because the ancients lived a short life,

He died before he could get the disease.

In 2015, the medical community announced the discovery,

A new antibiotic,

It is said that all bacteria are not resistant to it at present,

Now the medical community agrees,

This medicine may turn the world around,

It will be revolutionary.

So in such scientific and technological innovation,

Very likely,

Through a nano robot,

Patrolling the human body,

Find the disease,

Kill pathogens and cancer cells.

Can biotechnology make human beings live forever?

The author said that it is possible,

But he also threatened,

The survival of the human population,

Since he can defeat the virus,

It can also destroy a population,

One day there was a strange doctor,

Developed a deadly virus,

And let him spread quickly,

It will be more terrible than terrorists,

Even bring uncontrollable consequences.

So with the development of science and technology,

It is becoming more and more difficult to prevent this biochemical attack,

They say they can't die,

Now humans are at this stage,

If there is a big crisis in the future,

It's basically made.

Besides war,

The jungle law of the jungle,

It has always been the rule of history,

This also makes war a historical necessity,

Even compared to war,

Peace is short.

In ancient agricultural times,

15% died because of the war,

In the 20th century, the proportion fell to 5%,

It dropped to 1% at the beginning of the 21st century.

In 2012, 56 million people died worldwide,

Only 620000 people died of violence,

120000 of them died in the war,

Half a million people died in crime,

Do you think this number is a lot?

Just compare it,

800000 people died of suicide,

1 million 500 thousand people died of diabetes.

So now sugar is more terrible than gunpowder.

Is a World War Possible,

Fight again?

The author says it's impossible,

Poverty makes war,

Rwanda invaded the Congo in 1998,

To grab the iron ore,

It is said that after the invasion, it can earn 240 million dollars a year,

So will China g invade Silicon Valley,

No, because even if it invades,

You can't get anything.

You might as well do business with the United States,

One year's income from iron ore robbed by Rwanda,

Nor is there more trade between China and the United States in a day,

So peaceful development is the theme,

The world has become more and more peaceful.

So I don't understand those who buy military industry,

What is their mentality?

This is totally inconsistent with the general trend of world development,

Absolutely event driven,

How likely is it that China and G will use force with other countries?

India D soldiers pressed the border, but they just threw a few stones.

So don't be a whore,

With the globalization of trade,

And the nuclear deterrence of major powers,

Has drifted away,

It won't even happen,

Develop those weapons,

It's just daily expenses,

It doesn't work at all,

I can't make money.

As for terrorists,

Just people who don't get power,

A weak strategy,

Terrorism cannot defeat the army,

The number of deaths they caused in 2010,

Only 7600 people,

Three million people died of obesity in the same period,

So by contrast, Coca Cola,

Is the greatest terrorism.

Since famine, plague and war,

Has disappeared from human life,

Then there must be something new to fill in,

So what is the new issue now?

The author says that mankind will continue to pursue greater success,

The ambition of Conquest will further expand,

We now want to conquer death,

Even break away from animal attributes,

From man to God.

In the 100 years of the 21st century,

Human beings are likely to achieve immortality,

Now death is for people,

It's just a technical problem.

If there is no death,

So for traditional religions,

It will be a huge blow,

Reincarnate these,

The doctrine of afterlife will lose its meaning.

As medicine becomes more powerful,

There are more and more ways to treat death,

Change a heart, or get an antibiotic,

Just a replacement part.

Or the task of modern medicine is,

To help mankind overcome death,

In 2012, Kurzweil,

Appointed Google engineering director,

As a result, Google has established a subsidiary,

His clear mission is to challenge death,

Maris, CEO of Google venture capital,

Specializing in this investment in life,

He said if you asked me today,

Can people live to 500,

My answer is yes.

With the support of capital,

Genetic engineering, regenerative medicine, nanotechnology,

More and more optimistic,

Some experts believe that at the current rate,

Death can be defeated in 2200,

Some people are optimistic that in 2100,

Almost.

Some people say that I can't wait 2200 years,

Even in 2100,

I can't stand it. What should I do,

Scientists still have a way,

Let's break it down next time!
