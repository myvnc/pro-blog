GMO-Z.com Trade UK Limited, a subsidiary of GMO Financial Holdings Inc., has extended its prime brokerage offerings by launching Agency FX service in UK and [Hong Kong](https://forex.z.com/hk/en/forex_trading) recently.

As detailed in the press release, the new services will be offered under the existing Z.com Global Markets, the company’s institution-focused service brand.

Commenting on the new offering, Ramy Soliman, chief strategy officer at GMO-Z.com, said: “…I believe that the offering we have put together is well-positioned to go above and beyond in meeting the sophisticated requirements of institutional clients, such as smaller hedge funds or tier 2-3 banks, seeking consolidated access to high-quality curated liquidity.”

Prime-of-Prime Service

Z.com Global Markets is regulated under the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and was launched last November. It is a part of the GMO Internet Group, which includes GMO CLICK Securities Inc, which is one of the world’s largest retail foreign exchange (forex) providers by volume.

“By utilizing our direct relationships with tier 1 banks, non-bank providers, and leading ECN venues, we’re able to construct a bespoke liquidity solution for our clients to provide unified access to multiple quality sources, which is backed by our experienced team and strong technology offering,” Soliman added. 

“By leveraging our strong liquidity relationships, we are able to manage and optimize the pricing we provide to our clients to facilitate the best possible execution experience.”

He highlighted that a number of existing platform clients are already ‘engaged and ready’ to use the new services. Furthermore, the company has plans to expand its coverage in the coming months.
