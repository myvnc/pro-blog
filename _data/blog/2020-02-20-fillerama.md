## **1. What is foreign exchange**

Foreign exchange is a foreign currency or a means of payment expressed in foreign currency that can be used for international settlement. Article 3 of the regulations on the administration of foreign exchange promulgated in 1996 stipulates the specific contents of foreign exchange as follows: foreign exchange refers to:

① Foreign currency. Including paper money and coinage.

② Foreign currency payment voucher. Including bills, bank payment vouchers, postal savings vouchers, etc.

③ Foreign currency securities. Including government bonds, corporate bonds, stocks, etc.

④ Special drawing rights, European monetary units.

⑤ Other assets denominated in foreign currencies.

## **2. Exchange rate and pricing method**

Exchange rate, also known as exchange rate, refers to the price of one country's currency expressed in the currency of another country, or the price ratio between the currencies of the two countries.

In the foreign exchange market, the exchange rate is displayed in five digits, such as:

EUR 0.9705

JPY 119.95

GBP 1.5237

CHF 1.5003

The minimum change unit of exchange rate is one point, that is, the change of the last digit, such as:

EUR 0.0001

JPY 0.01

GBP 0.0001

CHF 0.0001

According to international practice, three English letters are usually used to represent the name of the currency (English code of the currency).

## **3. Direct price method and indirect price method**

There are two kinds of pricing methods of exchange rate: direct pricing method and indirect pricing method.

**(1) Direct pricing method**

The direct pricing method, also known as the payable pricing method, is to calculate the number of units of domestic currency payable based on the foreign currency of a certain unit (1, 100, 1000, 10000). It is equivalent to calculating the amount of functional currency payable for purchasing a certain unit of foreign currency, so it is called the payable price method. At present, most countries in the world, including China, adopt the direct pricing method. In the international foreign exchange market, the yen, Swiss franc and Canadian dollar are all marked directly, such as 119.05 yen, that is, 119.05 yen per US dollar.

Under the direct pricing method, if the amount of foreign currency converted into local currency of a certain unit is more than that in the previous period, it indicates that the value of foreign currency increases or the value of local currency decreases, which is called the rise of foreign exchange rate; On the contrary, if you want to use less local currency than the original, you can exchange the same amount of foreign currency, which indicates that the value of foreign currency falls or the value of local currency rises, which is called the decline of foreign exchange rate, that is, the value of foreign currency is directly proportional to the rise and fall of exchange rate.

**(2) Indirect pricing method**

Indirect pricing method is also called receivable pricing method. It is based on the local currency of a certain unit (such as 1 unit) to calculate the foreign currency receivable of several units. In the international foreign exchange market, the euro, pound sterling and Australian dollar are all indirectly priced. If the euro is 0.9705, that is, one euro is 0.9705 US dollars.

In the indirect pricing method, the amount of domestic currency remains unchanged, and the amount of foreign currency changes with the comparison of the value of domestic currency. If a certain amount of local currency can be exchanged for less foreign currency than in the previous period, it indicates that the value of foreign currency increases and the value of local currency decreases, that is, the foreign exchange rate decreases; On the contrary, if a certain amount of local currency can exchange more foreign currencies than in the previous period, it indicates that the value of foreign currency decreases and the value of local currency increases, that is, the foreign exchange rate increases, that is, the value of foreign currency is inversely proportional to the rise and fall of exchange rate.

The quotation in the foreign exchange market is generally a two-way quotation, that is, the bidder shall quote its own buying price and selling price at the same time, and the trading direction shall be determined by the customer. The smaller the difference between the bid price and the ask price, the smaller the cost for investors. The quotation point spread of inter-bank transactions is normally 2-3 points. The quotation point spread of banks (or dealers) to customers varies greatly according to each situation. At present, the quotation point spread of foreign margin transactions is basically 3-5 points, that of [Hong Kong forex trading](https://forex.z.com/hk/en/forex_trading) is 6-8 points, and that of domestic banks is 10-40 points.

## **5. Foreign exchange market**

The [foreign exchange platform](https://forex.z.com/hk/tc/whyzcomtrade/trustedtrading.html)refers to the trading place engaged in foreign exchange trading, or the place where various currencies are exchanged with each other. The foreign exchange market exists because:

**\-Trade and investment**

Importers and exporters pay one currency when importing goods and charge another currency when exporting goods. This means that when they close their accounts, they receive and pay in different currencies. Therefore, they need to convert some of the money they receive into money that can be used to buy goods. Similarly, a company that buys foreign assets must pay in the currency of the party, so it needs to convert its domestic currency into the currency of the party.

**\-Speculation**

The exchange rate between the two currencies will change with the change of supply and demand between the two currencies. A trader can make a profit by buying a currency at one exchange rate and selling it at a more favorable exchange rate. Speculation accounts for about the vast majority of transactions in the foreign exchange market.

**\-Hedge**

Due to exchange rate fluctuations between the two related currencies, companies with foreign assets (such as factories) may suffer some risks when converting these assets into the currency of the cost country. When the value of foreign assets denominated in foreign currency remains unchanged for a period of time, if the exchange rate changes, the value of this asset will be translated into domestic currency, which will produce profit and loss. The company can eliminate this potential profit and loss through hedging. This is the execution of a foreign exchange transaction, the result of which just offsets the profit and loss of foreign currency assets caused by exchange rate changes.

## **6. Major players in the foreign exchange market**

Participants in the foreign exchange market mainly include central banks, commercial banks, non bank financial institutions, brokerage companies, dealers and large multinational enterprises. They have frequent transactions and huge transaction amounts, with each transaction in millions of dollars or even more than tens of millions of dollars. Participants in foreign exchange transactions can be divided into investors and speculators according to their trading purposes.
