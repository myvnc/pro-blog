Hello everyone,\
\
Today we will share another rich dad book,\
\
Let me tell you about the concept of investment,\
\
This book is called the Rich Dad series,\
\
Find a job for your money.\
\
This book talks about the concept of investment,\
\
But unlike other professional investors,\
\
Speaking very deeply, so I want to manage money.\
\
Novice users who want to invest are a must for brainwashing,\
\
If you can’t establish the common sense and logic of these investments,\
\
Then investing is tantamount to suicide.\
\
Many people often ask such a question,\
\
I have tens of thousands of dollars, what should I invest in?\
\
Honestly, this question is difficult to answer,\
\
Rich dad said the same thing,\
\
People of all kinds,\
\
It is impossible to give you a cookie-cutter answer.\
\
Later he learned ghosts,\
\
He said that if someone asks you again,\
\
You say if you don’t know what to invest,\
\
You put him in the bank,\
\
Some people say, this rich dad is too watery.\
\
Actually not,\
\
He said that everyone is hearing too many suggestions.\
\
Not too few, for example, if you open the official account,\
\
Someone will let you buy a house, and some will not let you buy a house,\
\
Someone will let you clear the position, but another group will teach you to open the position.\
\
So listen to other people’s suggestions,\
\
Also facing the problem of stock selection,\
\
Who should I listen to? After listening to him,\
\
Will you always listen to him,\
\
Many people listened to Zhang San’s buying,\
\
Then he listened to Li Si and asked him to sell it.\
\
In addition, many people often take it out of context,\
\
Some people would say that Buffett is a stock god,\
\
He bought a good company and held it for a long time.\
\
It's that simple,\
\
But most people won’t tell you,\
\
Buffett is an equity investor,\
\
He is not a stockholder at all,\
\
He almost never cared about stock prices,\
\
Just focus on the company’s profitability,\
\
So the last thing rich dad actually wants to say is,\
\
When you don’t know what to invest in,\
\
You should invest your money in your head,\
\
Invest in yourself first,\
\
Instead of blindly inquiring about investment products.\
\
The author talked about a personal experience,\
\
He said that when he was young, someone also gave him advice,\
\
Great investors buy and hold for a long time,\
\
He was also at a loss at the time.\
\
Until one day I found rich dad.\
\
Rich dad asked him puzzledly,\
\
Why buy a fund, do you know him?\
\
Just these two questions confuse the author.\
\
So he repeated what the referee had said,\
\
All the masters are buying and holding for a long time,\
\
Then get rich returns.\
\
\
Then rich dad started to educate him,\
\
It’s not that you did something wrong,\
\
It’s a good thing to pay attention to investment early.\
\
But rich dad also said,\
\
I am not concerned with what you have invested in,\
\
I am concerned with you.\
\
Long-term investment, buy and hold,\
\
This statement itself is not an investment method.\
\
It’s just a marketing technique,\
\
He is not a financial education,\
\
Many people understand it wrong, including the author,\
\
They regard the marketing skills as financial education,\
\
So I will lose a lot of money later,\
\
these questions,\
\
We will answer them one by one later,\
\
Let's sell it first.

The next question, the stock market fell,\
\
Where did the money go? Many people don’t understand,\
\
Dozens of trillions evaporate without even letting go?\
\
In fact, he did not evaporate, but just transferred,\
\
The stock market will make most investors poorer,\
\
And only make a few investors get richer,\
\
This is actually the case in any investment market,\
\
Only a few people make money.\
\
The more I say it, the more mysterious it may become,\
\
Do you want to sell the stock now?\
\
This is actually not the point. ,\
\
The point is that you have to be able to distinguish,\
\
What is sales and what is financial advice.\
\
Later, the author was at a loss.\
\
I don’t know what the mystery is,\
\
He continued to buy the fund,\
\
But he is a poor student,\
\
So funding is stretched,\
\
He sometimes goes to see the performance of the fund,\
\
But no surprises, feeling drowsy.\
\
After the rich dad found out, he immediately laughed at him.\
\
Said he was almost impatient,\
\
At this time rich dad finally said,\
\
A very important point,\
\
He said, when you are one,\
\
When impatient investors,\
\
You will be very sloppy,\
\
Impatient buying,\
\
It will inevitably lead you to sell more impatiently.\
\
The author tried to defend,\
\
But they only asked him one question,\
\
How long did you talk to the salesperson before buying?\
\
The author said one hour,\
\
Rich dad laughed even more after listening.\
\
An hour of conversation,\
\
You want to make a decision that will change your life's destiny,\
\
Isn't this sloppy?\
\
So the first lesson you should learn is,\
\
The worst investment is for impatient investors.\
\
And this lesson is priceless,\
\
It’s a pity that many people lose a lot of money,\
\
Still haven't learned this lesson.

\
If you invest rashly, you will inevitably leave the market rashly.\
\
The time you spend researching an investment,\
\
Determines how firm you hold it,\
\
Don’t ask others about a certain stock, a certain fund,\
\
I bought it by myself, others didn’t buy it,\
\
So I should know better than others.\
\
A holder consults the opinion of a non-holder,\
\
It's ridiculous in itself.\
\
Rich dad said that most investors’ problems,\
\
It's in himself and not in what he bought,\
\
He bought very good things,\
\
If he is impatient,\
\
It will also lose a lot of money.\
\
Someone said, we all have jobs,\
\
How can I have time to research investment,\
\
But the question is who is not working?\
\
If you don’t have time to study now,\
\
I also don’t have time to study in the future,\
\
Lack of patience, laziness, lack of knowledge,\
\
Plus the excuse of not having time,\
\
Your investment results,\
\
Can you imagine it?\
\
Rich dad said,\
\
For a person who lacks patience,\
\
Any investment will lose money,\
\
So he never cared about what the author bought,\
\
Because you will lose money if you buy anything.\
\
then what should we do? How to become,\
\
What about a professional investor?\
\
Rich dad said, professional investors,\
\
Always make yourself smarter,\
\
But ordinary investors only focus on making money.\
\
If you simply buy funds every month,\
\
Then you will not learn any relevant investment knowledge,\
\
An empty head will inevitably affect your final patience.\
\
You don’t know the style of the fund,\
\
I don’t know his size,\
\
I don’t even know which stocks he invested in,\
\
Even more ignorant of fund managers,\
\
So the market is going up okay,\
\
As long as the market falls,\
\
You collapsed right away,\
\
Living in the dark forest is the scariest thing,\
\
Because everything is unknown.\
\
In fact, in the world of investment,\
\
The funds will not disappear, he just changed hands,\
\
In other words, your money goes,\
\
Go in someone else's pocket.\
\
Just like a house, I sold the house to you,\
\
I took away the wealth,\
\
And you got the house,\
\
I hope that in the future there will be a young man with a higher price,\
\
Take the house from you,\
\
But this is just your imagination,\
\
But I actually took your money away.\
\
\
Later, in order to give them financial education, rich dad\
\
I took the author to visit the ranch and the dairy farm respectively,\
\
The ranch is to drive the cows into the cowshed and then slaughter them.\
\
Every cow that enters the barn is full of despair.\
\
But cows are different,\
\
They often enter the cowshed for milking,\
\
So I'm very used to it,\
\
Rich dad said,\
\
This is the biggest difference between pasture and dairy farm,\
\
One is capital gains,\
\
One requires cash flow.\
\
What the two investors are pursuing is,\
\
Completely different benefits,\
\
And many investors always lose money,\
\
Or they think that investment is a huge risk,\
\
Because they always position themselves on the pasture,\
\
Either slaughter others or being slaughtered by others.\
\
And the other part, investors who are pursuing cash flow,\
\
People like Buffett Peter Lynch,\
\
But they live freely,\
\
Live peacefully with everyone,\
\
Not so much blood and rain,\
\
No one has ever said that Buffett cuts leeks,\
\
Because every time he flashes people early,\
\
But you are still rushing in,\
\
And until you cried and cried out,\
\
He just came out to pick up bargains.\
\
So what kind of person,\
\
Is the investor in the ranch,\
\
In fact, everyone is basically,\
\
I often say that my house has appreciated in value,\
\
My stock has gone up,\
\
I made money in the stock market.\
\
And the investors of other people’s cash flow,\
\
Usually don’t chat like this,\
\
They usually say,\
\
The house I invested in,\
\
It can bring me 10,000 yuan in return every month,\
\
My stock dividends are basically covered every year,\
\
My food and wear,\
\
How much money this company can make in the future and so on.\
\
Rich dad said,\
\
The biggest fool is to pursue,\
\
Those with a capital premium,\
\
Those who make the difference will die ugly in the end.\
\
He said that many companies don’t even have a profit.\
\
The stock price can also be fired up,\
\
Then every day there are a bunch of people looking for reasons to buy him.\
\
This is called Bosha,\
\
It’s a game sillier than anyone else,\
\
During the boom of the stock market,\
\
There are often such things everywhere,\
\
The current property market is a silly pattern,\
\
The house can no longer generate value through rent,\
\
But there are still so many people buying crazy,\
\
Just to earn the spread.\
\
Investment is actually a use of today’s money,\
\
In exchange for tomorrow's continuous income,\
\
So the focus is on income,\
\
Instead of how much money he can sell in the future,\
\
If it can be sold at a higher price,\
\
It was a character explosion,\
\
Or as long as your eyes are on cash flow,\
\
Then there will definitely be one in the future,\
\
Huge capital premium space,\
\
Instead you keep staring at the capital premium,\
\
Often they don't get this opportunity to make money.\
\
So everyone should have one,\
\
Milking investment thinking,\
\
I buy a stock,\
\
How many years will I recover my investment,\
\
I don't know how many people have calculated this.\
\
Take, for example, Yunnan Baiyao,\
\
Take 2018 as an example, the price-earnings ratio is 28 times,\
\
His annual net profit growth rate is 15%,\
\
This year’s earnings per share is 3.2 yuan,\
\
So counting, after 10 years,\
\
You will pass the asset of Yunnan Baiyao,\
\
A total of 78 yuan per share was earned.\
\
\
And his stock price is 87 yuan,\
\
So do the math, do you think it is appropriate?\
\
Assuming that the stock price does not rise,\
\
At that time it is still 87 yuan,\
\
Then your return is 89%,\
\
The annualized rate of return is almost 7%.\
\
This is our cash flow investment thinking,\
\
Next time we will continue to introduce the usage of this kind of thinking,\
\
He will make your investment invincible.
