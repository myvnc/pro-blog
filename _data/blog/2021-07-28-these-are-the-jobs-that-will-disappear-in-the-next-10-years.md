## By 2030, entire industries will disappear

> *We never underestimate the changes that will take place in the next two-years. Underestimating the changes that will take place in the next ten years is dangerous.*

We are my friends, this is the beginning of a very bumpy road. As automation, AI, Quantum computing, blockchain, and unaccountable multinationals Corporations invade the workforce and overthrow the global economy. We are facing a new joblessness crisis that is unprecedented in its scale.

Although we don't have the exact numbers, estimates suggest that automation could result in the loss of 800 million to 2 billion jobs within the next ten years.

This will cause a lot of economic and political turmoil -- and how? The joblessness crisis is dealt with, and it will be relegated to the history books. Inspiration for future generations or a cautionary tale.

Let's take a look at some of the job opportunities.



# Drivers

Uber and Lyft hate their employees so much that they refuse to call them employees and have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to quash their worker rights.

Do not expect them to show more respect for wealth-creators. Autonomous cars will soon be widely available to replace them.

Traditional taxis are the same.\
And pizza delivery drivers.\
And limo drivers.\
Truck drivers.\
And package delivery drivers asAmazon and Alibaba litter our skies with drones.



# Bankers

*The progressives are singing, good riddance*

After all, the banking industry is a major vampire to the productive economy.

There are virtually no banks that are offline, so there is a 98% chance of loan officer jobs disappearing. They're estimating nearly 2 million bank job losses in the US and UK alone.



# Bookkeepers and accountants

Tax preparers are particularly doomed.

Nearly everyone I know uses e-files. More people use tax apps.

H&R Block uses IBM's AI platform, *Watson.*

Most workers in the UK don't have to file as it is done automatically for them.



# Telemarketers

It's hard to believe America still has nearly 9,000 telemarketing companies.

I can see what you are thinking. "Hallelujah! No more spam calls!"

These companies employ over 500,000 of our neighbors. And The Guardian According to predictions, there is a 99% chance that telemarketing will become automated by the decade ahead. The chance of making cold-call sales is so low. The vast majority of people are now searching online for what they need. It is only natural that these jobs will vanish forever.



# Cashiers

Although I absolutely loathe self-checkout kiosks in grocery stores, let's not deny that they are an option. It: Major chains, from Kroger to McDonald's, would love to replace every one their counter staff with let-the-customers-do-all-the-work checkout Counters

Heck, Amazon and Whole Foods are even doing away with the kiosks themselves. The future is self-serve, regardless of whether we like it or not.

Add in the fact that online shopping continues to dominate in-store sales, and we're looking at a 97% chance that untold millions lose their livelihoods.



# These arenâ€™t the only jobs going away

We will be [losing millions in the years ahead](https://www.metisnation-sask.com/metis-jobs-and-business-america-is-drowning-in-joblessness-and-swimming-in-cash/)

* Travel agents (as people use Booking.com and community-destroying vacation sites like Airbnb)
* Paralegal and legal assistants (94% chance of automation)
* Fast-food cooks (hello Robo-flippers)
* Songwriters (hey Google)
* Translators and interpreters (hey Google!)
* Librarians (hey Google!)
* Booksellers (hey Amazon!)
* Coal and oil workers(solar/wind/geo have arrived)
* Teachers should expect better online schools such as iTunes U.
* Parking meter attendants(no more human grace, just tyrannical robotic surveillance)
* Air traffic controllers and pilots (think: drones and unmanned carriers)
* Newspaper reporters are the most tragic loss on this list
* Movie theatre workers (singing it with me Streaming killed the cinema star ).
* Lumberjacks (and janes) and fisher...people

If only we could fire the politicians and their anti-democracy corporate backers.



# However, new jobs are sure to be created...

Yes.

Perhaps.

In the vampire economy, these jobs will be more likely to be gigs -- less secure and with less control.

TheFuture jobs will require more education. We know this because anything about the corporatist takeover in the post-secondary education system, we can predict that it'll be the biggest debt trap ever created.

Were we able to offer full-time, true-living-wage employment to everyone when there are another 2+ billion people on the planet?

I am highly skeptical.

Also: It takes time to create new industries. Unemployed people don'tYou can wait for new jobs for decades, then you can go back to. To catch up, they will need to be in their fifties or forties.

The most dangerous period is the one during which transition occurs.



# At least my job's safe.

You might be in one of the automation safe zones: doctors, surgeons, or clergy.

Do not read it and say, "Whew! This doesn't affect me."

It does.

Big time.

First, joblessness will lead to *huge* competition for automation-safe jobs.

Second, estimates suggest half of all current work tasks could be automated. Even for those who do not lose their jobs, the effects of underemployment are likely to be chronic and systemic.

Third, tens of millions of people are in transition to work, which means that there are trillions. Support to shelter, feed, and support citizens.

The government will have to either raise your taxes (the ultra-elite are not going to pay their fair share) or steal it from your pockets by printing more money, increasing prices, and weakening your purchasing power.

Despite the fact that job-killing technology only benefits the wealthiest of the rich, When it comes to the economic consequences, both ways are possible. **You** will be worth it.



# Do the right thing

We need to provide generous support for the unemployed, underemployed and underpaid -- this is what I mean **All living expenses and re-education are covered until they get back on their feet.**.. Sustainable basic income.

Human workers have made *hundreds and billions*. In value for shareholders, it's only right those elites should be recognized. Should pay their fair share to take care of those who have so. They are taken very well care of.

Yes, we will 100% need a robot tax.

But it remains to be seen whether or not the elites will wake up and realize the future they're creating.

To make room for others, we all need to open up our hearts, homes, wallets, and minds.

And If not, we'll be on the streets of LA, New York and many other cities. Cities flooded by permanently unemployed, rightfully angry people

Enjoy running your business or economy in this kind of chaos.
