**Forex Trading**

Why do you need to simplify forex trading?

Complexity is the way to overwhelm. You find yourself ignoring other key parts of currency trading, which are equally important to help you increase your profit margins. This is because there are many factors that affect the trend of foreign exchange currency pairs.

For example, suppose the price of GBP/USD is 1.36775. Due to political, economic and social factors, prices may change in the next hour.

Since these three factors will lead to price direction on average, controlling the market requires three analyses to help you make reasonable decisions. These are technical, sentiment and fundamental analysis.

Fundamental analysis needs to understand why the quantity and price of goods change. It involves an in-depth study of economic, political, and social changes and their impact on the direction of prices.

Sentiment analysis requires listening to the foreign exchange trends predicted by other (most experienced) investors. Sentiment analysis drives sentiment in trading.

The more you pay attention to the opinions of other investors, the more likely you are to ignore other types of analysis. In the end, you will find yourself doing noise trading-making decisions based on opinions. The solution to noise trading is technical analysis.

**In-depth study of technical analysis**

Technical analysis involves understanding when the price of a foreign exchange currency pair may change. Falling and rising prices determine the trend on the chart.

Technical analysis tools and indicators can guide you to determine when to sell or buy a currency. Technical indicators are signals that show currency pair patterns. The four most typical technical indicators are:

* Moving average
* MACD
* RSI
* Slow random

**Moving average** is a calculation that analyzes data points by creating a series of averages. It is subdivided into simple moving average (SMA) and exponential moving average (EMA). Although both reflect price changes over a period of time, EMA can better understand current price data.

Calculating the moving average is easy. For example, to find the 20-day SMA for a currency pair, write down the daily high, low, closing or opening price. Next, add the daily prices and divide by 20.

Another technical indicator is **MACD**, short for Moving Average Convergence and Divergence. It determines the uptrend and downtrend by measuring the difference between two moving averages. Moving averages are exponentially smoothed.

The Relative Strength Index (**RSI**) shows the strength of past and current currency pairs, depending on the recent closing price. It will guide you to find when a currency is overbought or oversold. If you like to buy when the foreign exchange currency pair is extremely low and sell when the price reaches its peak, then RSI is for you.

The **slow stochastic** indicator allows you to understand the closing position related to the current trading range. It consists of two lines %K and %D, swinging between 0-100 vertical scales. %D is the average of %K-the main line.

A %D higher than 75 indicates an overbought situation. It can help you determine when to trade. For example, you should buy when the fast %D rises above the slow %D. This may be the more exciting part.

**Step by step-on the path to success**

You don't have to laboriously collect and find technical indicator values. Trading platforms such as Metatrader4 simplify your trading by presenting various charts and technical indicators.
